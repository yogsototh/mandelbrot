# Parallel Mandelbrot Set with Haskell


A parallel generation of the Mandelbrot set.

It uses repa and repa-devil.

As always Haskell rocks.

Don't look too much to the quality of this code.
It is more a hack than a real project.
But it remains a nice example.

And a video made with `avconv` (`ffmpeg`); see the `run` script: [https://vimeo.com/61190538](https://vimeo.com/61190538).
